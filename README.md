**Melanoma** is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

Our application detects the following diseases:
- Actinic keratosis
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Dermatofibroma
- Melanoma
- Nevus
- Pigmented benign keratosis
- Seborrheic keratosis
- Squamous cell carcinoma
- Vascular lesion

- Streamlit
- Machine Learning

### APIs used

- [Google maps API for places](https://maps.googleapis.com): Our website will calculate latitude and longitude values of current location and it will fetch all nearby 
dermatologists.

## How it works?

Our application utilizes machine learning to predict what skin disease you may have, from just your skin images!
We then recommend you specialized doctors based on your type of disease, if our model predicts you're healthy we'll 
suggest you a general doctor.
